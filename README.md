Have a look, it's a 54 pages report detailling exactly how we proceeded to build and make this functionnal drone. 


# Disclaimer
The code is very messy in here, big apologies, 100% garanteed I would not put this in production like this, the code is not factorized nor cleaned. The focus during this project where on electronics and especially on key concepts : PID feedback loops, Euler Angles equations, etc...
